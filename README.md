# Bear.Ninja.Hunter

Bear.Ninja.Hunter is a web browser based rock, paper, scissors type game. In this case I'm using bear, ninja, hunter (bear eats ninja, ninkja kills hunter, hunter shoots bear). The player plays a game of chance against the computer, and if the player beats the computer to 5 wins, they will get an alert with a fun fact about bears (or ninjas, or hunters!).  

# UX

The website draws the player direcly into the game. 

# UI

While the game required minimal interface between the user and the computer, simple pseudo styles are added to the selectors to give the player a deeper sense of engagement with the game. Sound effects are played when the player has won a round, and a fun fact is displayed if the player beats the computor to 5 wins.

# Design

**Imagery**

The images for bear, hunter and ninja were downloaded from [pinterest.com](www.pinterest.com). Whenever a character loses a round, their image will be replaced with a 'sad' image. 

**Fonts**

I'm using the font [Press Start P2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P), which is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco arcade games. Incase the user's browser doesn't support this font I'm using sans-serif as a back up.

**Colours**

I want this game to look retro, stylish and vibrant so I'm using the following colours.

- #A8D0E6 is used for the background.
- #F76C6C is used for the footer.
- #F8E9A1 is used for the game outcome text.

The rest of the text is plain black to keep the retro look.
